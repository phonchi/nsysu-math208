The depth of the tree (and hence the time complexity of search, insert, and delete operations) can vary widely depending on the order of insertion. For instance, inserting elements in sorted order into a BST can produce a tree that is essentially a linked list, with a time complexity of $O(n)$ for basic operations.\n","\n","2. **AVL Tree:**\n","   - An AVL tree is a type of BST that maintains a stricter balance.\n","   - To ensure balance, the AVL tree maintains a balance factor for each node, defined as the height of the left subtree minus the height of the right subtree. This balance factor must always be -1, 0, or +1.\n","   - After every insertion or deletion, the AVL tree performs rotations if necessary to restore the balance factor requirement. These rotations help to ensure that the tree remains balanced, leading to time complexities of $O(log n)$ for search, insert, and delete operations.\n","\n","In summary, while both AVL trees and BSTs follow the basic principles of binary search trees, AVL trees include mechanisms to ensure the tree remains balanced, thereby guaranteeing better performance for operations in the worst-case scenarios."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### (11) Which of the inorder/preorder or inorder/postorder or preorder/postorder sequences of a binary tree can determine a unique binary tree?

Combining these two, you can uniquely identify the structure of the binary tree because the root element from the preorder sequence can split the inorder sequence into left and right subtrees, which recursively can be used to reconstruct the entire tree.\n","\n","2. **Inorder and Postorder**:\n","   - **Uniqueness**: Yes, the pair of an inorder and postorder traversal can also uniquely determine a binary tree.\n","   - **Reason**: Similar to the inorder and preorder combination, here the postorder gives the root at the end of the sequence.
