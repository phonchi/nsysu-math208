The rationale for not using compact arrays, which are traditional linear arrays to store sparse matrices, stems from considerations of memory efficiency and computational performance. Storing a sparse matrix in a compact array format would require allocating memory for each element, including the zeros, which is highly inefficient given that the vast majority of the elements do not carry useful information."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### (6) What is the Big O complexity to remove an element from an array?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Ans: The Big O complexity to remove an element from an array depends on the position of the element being removed:\n","\n","Worst Case (removing the first element or an element at a specific position): \n","$O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array.

Unlike traditional dense matrix storage that requires space for every element, COO stores only the non-zero elements. It does this by maintaining three arrays: one for the row indices, one for the column indices, and one for the values of the non-zero elements. Each entry in these arrays corresponds to a non-zero element in the matrix, with the row and column arrays indicating the position of the element, and the value array holding the element's actual value. This format is particularly useful for matrices with a large number of zeros because it significantly reduces memory usage.
