You can pass the `len()` function a string value (or a variable containing a string), and the function evaluates to the integer value of the number of characters in that string.

The `str()` function can be passed an integer value and will evaluate to a string value version of the integer.

The `int()` function is also helpful if you have a number as a string value that you want to use in some mathematics. For example, the `input()` function always returns a string, even if the user enters a number. The `myAge` variable contains the value returned from `input()`. You can use the `int(myAge)` code to return an integer value of the string in `myAge`. This integer value is then added to 1 in the expression `int(myAge) + 1`. The result of this addition is passed to the `str()` function: `str(int(myAge) + 1)`. The string value returned is then concatenated with the strings `'You will be '` and `' in a year.'` to evaluate one large string value.
