When the operands for the division are popped from the stack, they are reversed. Since division is not a commutative operator,  we must be sure that the order of the operands is not switched!"

If we can keep matching first and the last items, we will eventually either run out of characters or be left with a deque of size 1 depending on whether the length of the original string was even or odd. In either case, the string must be a palindrome. "

    "1. **Linear ADT**: ADT where data elements are arranged in a sequential order, and each member element is connected to its previous and next element in a single level. Examples include stacks, and queues.\n",

    "2. **Stack**: A linear data structure that follows a particular order in which operations are performed. The order is Last In First Out (LIFO). This means the element added last is the first one to be removed.\n",

    "3. **Front**: In the context of queues, the \"front\" refers to the start of the queue. It's where the first element resides, and from where elements are removed during the dequeue operation.\n",

    "4. **Rear**: In the context of queues, the \"rear\" is the end of the queue. It's where new elements are added during the enqueue operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Top**: In the context of stacks, the \"top\" refers to the last added element, which is the first one to be removed due to the LIFO policy. It's the current endpoint of the stack.\n",

    "14. **Deque**: Short for \"double-ended queue,\" it's a type of data structure that allows insertion and removal of elements from both the front and the rear. This makes it a more flexible structure than standard queues or stacks."
