    "1. **Recursion**: A programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. It breaks down a problem into smaller, more manageable parts until reaching a base case that can be solved directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Base Case**: In recursion, the base case is a condition that stops the recursion by not allowing the function to call itself. It typically represents the simplest instance of the problem, which can be solved without further recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Stack Frame**: A stack frame, or activation record, is a portion of the stack memory that contains all the information necessary to execute a function call, including parameter values, return address, and local variables. Each recursive call creates a new stack frame on the call stack.\n",

    "4. **Fractals**: Geometric figures that are self-similar across different scales. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. They are often used in computer graphics to generate natural-looking scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Dynamic Programming**: A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems, solving each subproblem just once, and storing their solutions. It is used when the subproblems overlap, as in memorization or bottom-up approach, to optimize the overall problem-solving process by avoiding redundant calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Greedy Method**: A problem-solving strategy that makes the best choice at each step as it attempts to find the overall optimal way to solve the entire problem. This method hopes to find the global optimum by making locally optimal choices at each step, but it does not guarantee an optimal solution for all problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Memoization**: A technique used in dynamic programming to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. It is a specific form of caching that is used to reduce the computational cost of re-calculating results."
